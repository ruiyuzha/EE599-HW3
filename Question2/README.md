# HW3-Q2

## Description:

Given a vector of integers v, and a number sum, return a vector of two items which are the indices of the two numbers in v such that they add up to sum.

- If there is no answer, the return vector should be empty.

- If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

Example 1:

Input v = [3, 7, 11, 15], sum = 10

output: [0, 1], sum=10 (because v[0] + v[1] = 10)

Example 2:

Input v = [3, 7, 11, 15], sum = 180, output: []

Example 3:

Input v = [1, 4, 3, 2], sum = 5,

output: either [0, 1] OR [2, 3] is the correct answer.

Hint:â€‹ Create a map that maps each number in v to its index.
