# HW3-Q4

## Description

Given an expression string, find if the input has valid brackets (i.e. { } or [ ] or ( ) ).

An input expression is valid if:

● Open brackets are closed by the same type of brackets.

● Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

● An empty string is also considered valid.

You should ​only​ check for the validity of brackets based on the above rules, i.e. ‘(‘, ‘)’, ‘[‘, ‘]’, ‘{‘, ‘}’, not the rest of the expression.

Hint​: Iterate the input from beginning to end and use a ​std:stack​.

Example 1: Input: "(a+b)" Output: true

Example 2:Input: "(a+b)[c*d]{5g+h}" Output: true

Example 3: Input: "(a+b]" Output: false

Example 4: Input: "(7h+[5c)+7]" Output: false

Example 5: Input: "{2k+[5j]}" Output: true

Example 6: Input: "{2k++[5--*j]}" Output: true
